    <p>Hi, my name is Michelle and i am doing an apprenticeship for media design.</p>
    <br>I am 23 years old and i was born in cologne but later moved to düsseldorf for my apprenticeship.
    <br>My favourite colors are purple, pink and black.
    <br>I love baking. Going to Fleamarkets, taking photos (with my polaroid camera!)
    <br>And as you can probably tell, I like everything &copy;Sanrio.
